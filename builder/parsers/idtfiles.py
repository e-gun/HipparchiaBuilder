	parse a non-ascii bookmark that sets or increments one of the counters that keep track of what line, chapter, book, etc. we are currently at
	the perl function retruns all sorts of random things at various junctures if various conditions are met: a fairly unclean function

		a new bytecount position
	   the newLeftvalue
